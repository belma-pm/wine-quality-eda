# Wine Quality EDA

## Objective
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Wine Quality dataset.
The goal is to understand variable distributions, relationships,
and extract insights from physicochemical attributes.

## Dataset
This project uses the Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle.
The dataset contains physicochemical features such as acidity,
pH, alcohol, sulphates, and a quality score.

The dataset is provided as a single CSV file (`WineQT.csv`)
and is licensed under **CC0 Public Domain**.

## Analysis Steps
- Data loading and inspection
- Missing value analysis
- Univariate analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization of key relationships

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Conclusion
This EDA provides a clear understanding of the dataset structure
and highlights key variables that influence wine quality.
